# Google Python Projects

Welcome! Here you'll see my projects related to the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** course. Not only that, but you'll also find exercises that I have personally completed to improve my programming skills within the course.

I have been coding for about 3 months now and already have a solid foundation. This repository is mainly to track my progress and keep everyone updated with what I am doing within this project!

## What you'll find here:
- **Projects**: All the work I've done as part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate course.
- **Exercises**: Personal exercises I've done to strengthen my programming skills.
